The initial plan is to set up a repository that can serve as version control and
a safe place to store the code. 
  Next step is to start with an exploratory analysis of the input data and also
do online research into the different modelling options.

There are many columns, 96 to be exact, but not all of them are equally clean.
I will start with a prescription of a column that ensures they are of the right
 class and convert them to a useful format.
 Having done so, I have investigated the usefulness of the different columns. 
 Some columns were excluded because they had too little differerent information 
 or had too many NAs. 
After the data quality exclusion, the next step was some enhancement. This 
mainly consisted of making a few more fields or changing them into a more useful format.
 I have enhanced the calendar update since I had no legitimite reason to exclude it,
 created the field review_period to also look at listings that have been around 
 for a long time and lastly have considered common luxury amenities as a logical.
 
Now I have a long list of variables I would like to check for predictive power.
 I have found that there are two methods I can consider. A machine learning 
 method XGBoost and a more simple supervised machine learning method such as
 linear regression.
